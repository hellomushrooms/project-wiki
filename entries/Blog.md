# A Quiet Morning in the City 🌆

This morning, I woke up earlier than usual. The city was still asleep, the streets silent except for the distant hum of a train. There's something magical about these quiet moments — like the world is giving you a soft reset before the rush begins.

## The Smell of Coffee

I made myself a cup of coffee, opened the window, and just sat there. Watching the sky change color — from a pale gray to soft orange. I think I’m finally starting to enjoy the slow pace.

## A Reminder to Breathe

Sometimes we get so caught up in doing things, we forget to just *be*. This morning reminded me that rest is not a luxury — it’s necessary.

If you're reading this, take a moment right now. Close your eyes. Breathe in. And out. You’re doing okay.
